          The word "hippopotamus (or hippos)" means <dfn>"river horse".</dfn> The hippopotamus is a mammal in the
          family
          Hippopotamus. It is one of
          the most <dfn>representative animals in
            Africa.</dfn> However, the hippopotamuses are <strong>endangered animals.</strong> They live in <strong>high
            humidity.</strong> They spend an average of <time>18
            hours</time> a day in the water, and come out of the water to eat grass at night. It is considered one of
          the
          most <strong>aggressive and violent animals</strong> in Africa, and the <strong>hippopotamus' front
            teeth</strong> can cause fatal injuries.

        Hippos live mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. It used to live in other parts of North Africa and other continents,
        but it is
        now extinct because the temperature and climate do not match. In addition, the hippopotamus population is still
        decreasing throughout the continent. This is because illegal hunting is increasing in order to sell hippopotamus
        fangs
        on behalf of elephants' ivory in black markets in Africa.<br>
        <br>According to a 2008 survey, hippos now have 126,000 to 149,000 populations.

          The hippopotamus has portrayed as cute animals in many animations thanks to their large heads and cute little
          ears.
          However, the hippopotamus has a scary hidden figure. The hippopotamus' mouths
          <a id="jaw-angle" href="https://youtu.be/77QJFu6GEkM">can open up to 150
            degrees.</a>
          <sup><a href="#jaw-angle-refer">[2]</a></sup><br>

          <br>Also,
          the
          hippopotamus has a
          great length of fangs, which are as long as 60 centimeters. It is twice as long as the fangs of the
          Tyrannosaurus.
          Two-thirds of the hippopotamus' fangs are located inside the jawbone, and one-third can be seen from the
          mouth. Finally,
          the nostrils of hippopotamus are also developed to open and close easily in the water.

          Hippos have enormous bodies, while they have short legs and short tails.
          It has a total of four legs, and each foot has a nail-like hoof. And usually, males have a body size about
          30% larger
          than females.<br>

          <br>The hippopotamus has greyish-brown skin on its back and light pink skin on its belly. It has
          less hair
          throughout its body and only a little hair on its mouth, ears, and tail. The hippopotamus' four legs have
          webbed
          membranes developed between its toes so that it can swim in the water.

          An average of 20 to 30 hippos lives in groups.<br>

          <br>Hippos are very susceptible to ultraviolet light due to
          their skin characteristics compared to other animals. The hippopotamus can be badly hurt by only 18 hours of
          exposure to
          the sunlight. In some cases, hippos die from ultraviolet rays after only three days of exposure to
          sunlight.<br>

          <br>Therefore, hippos secrete red liquid, not blood, from their skin, which is similar to sweat, which
          protects the skin of hippos that are weak against ultraviolet rays. It also helps to maintain the body
          temperature of hippos. Most hippopotamuses' main habitat is Africa, where the sun is high in the jungle, so it
          lives almost underwater during the day and protects it from ultraviolet rays and keeps cool.

        Hippos, unlike they look, have tremendous characteristics. First, hippos are physically developed to live long
        in the water. The hippopotamus' ears, eyes, and nostrils are located on the highest part of the hippopotamus'
        body, so it can live in a state of immersion in the water. And when hippos swim in the water, they can close
        their ears and nostrils to block the water.<br>

        <br>The hippopotamus' bodies are also dense, allowing them to walk and swim in the water. Hippos
        have short legs, but the <a href="https://youtu.be/Su7GkqwxG08">speed of swimming in the water</a> is fast
        enough to follow a motorboat.<sup><a id="swimming-speed" href="#swimming-speed-refer">[6]</a></sup> In addition,
        the
        speed of running on land is also fast. Although the hippos' body is large, they can run up to 45 km/h.<br>

        <br>Hippos reach adulthood at the age of seven, weighing more than 1,200 kilograms and running at speeds of
        nearly 50 kilometers per hour. From this point on, the only animals that can compete against the hippopotamus
        one-on-one are homogeneous and elephants.<br>

        <br>The hippopotamus has a huge length of fangs and <a href="https://youtu.be/VxP1cp8KS1o">a powerful
          jaw.</a><sup><a id="jaw-strength" href="#jaw-strength-refer">[7]</a></sup>
        Their
        jaw strength is about a ton. And hippos have very thick leather with thick layers of fat. Their wound resilience
        is also very fast, with severe wounds recovering within 10 minutes.<br>

        <br>Hippos also have good hearing, so it does not matter to eat grass at night. Hippos put pressure on other
        animals with their low, ringing cries.<sup><a href="#sound-crying-refer">[8]</a></sup><br>

          <dfn style="margin-left: 50px;">This is hippo's crying sound</dfn>
        </figure>

        <br>Such a powerful and scary hippo is an animal that should never be touched because it is
        an animal that shows violence not only to other animals but also to humans.
